# Backswing Ecommerce

A modern ecommerce platform for selling apparel with cartoon-like designs, specifically tailored for padel enthusiasts.

## Problem

The client needed an easy way to sell products online without maintaining a physical store. They required a personalized, fast, secure storefront and an easy-to-manage stock and product characteristics system.

## Solution

To meet the client's needs, I developed the storefront using Next.js and hosted it on Vercel. For the backend, I used WordPress with WooCommerce (despite my preference for other solutions) as it is user-friendly for the client, who is not very tech-savvy. The WordPress site is hosted on Riaola Networks, a Spanish company, aligning with the client's location in southern Spain.

## Design

The design focuses on ease of use and a visually appealing interface to attract customers interested in cartoon-like padel apparel.
